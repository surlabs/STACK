# STACK Question plugin for ILIAS

Welcome to the official repository for [STACK for ILIAS](https://stackforilias.com).

## What is STACK?

STACK is the world-leading open-source online assessment system for mathematics and STEM and the most powerful STEM learning tool available in ILIAS

> **Note** STACK for ILIAS is from 01.06.2023 officially maintained on the **SURLABS** repository. Original ILIFAU repository has been archived, please change your git remote to the new one in order to keep using the plugin.

## Installation & Update

### Software Requirements
STACK requires [PHP](https://php.net) version 7.4 to work properly on your ILIAS platform

STACK requires the [mbstring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) PHP library to run properly, this library is by default included in ILIAS, but please ensure your installation includes that library on the composer.json dependencies.

STACK requires [Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/), an Open-Source Computer Algebra System to work. Ensure you have Maxima instance installed on the web server running your ILIAS installation, or you have a Maxima Pool / Goemaxima connection before installing this plugin in your platform.
* If you are using a local Maxima Installation, ensure it is at least Maxima 5.45
* If you are using MaximaPool or GoeMaxima, the expected compiled version is 2021120900

STACK requires [GNUPlot](https://www.gnuplot.info), which is used by Maxima to generate graphical plots of functions etc. It is freely available
and part of most Linux distrubutions. GNUplot needs to be installed on the web server
running your ILIAS and maxima installations.

STACK requires [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org), to be active on your ILIAS installation.

MathJax is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics. It is used by the STACK plugin
to display maths in question, user input validation and feedback. It can either be linked from
cdn.mathjax.org or downloaded to your own web server. It has to be configured in ILIAS:

1. Administration > Third Party Software > MathJax
2. Enable MathJax and enter the URL to MathJax (local or proposed cdn)
3. Save

### Installation steps
1. Create subdirectories, if necessary for Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/
2. In Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/ execute

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surlabs/STACK.git ./assStackQuestion
cd assStackQuestion
git checkout old_ilias7_stack2021
```
3. STACK uses the ILIAS composer autoloader functionality so, after installing or update the plugin, ensure you run on the ILIAS root folder
```bash
composer du
```
***
**Please ensure you don't ignore plugins on composer.json**
***
4. Go to Administration > Plugins
5. Choose action "Install" or "Update" for the assStackQuestion plugin
6. Choose action "Activate" for the assStackQuestion plugin
7. Choose action "Refresh Languages" for the assStackQuestion plugin
8. Choose action "Configure" for the assStackQuestion plugin
9. Set the platform type and maxima servers according your installation
10. Go to the tab "Health Check" and click "Do Health Check"

*If you can see the 3 Plots being rendered at the end of the screen, the plugin has been properly installed*

**Please, repeat this sequence everytime you update STACK**
