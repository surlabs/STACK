## STACK Question Cleanup Script User Guide

## Introduction
> This is a script that allows you to perform a search for STACK questions with clearly identifiable errors. And in some cases it gives you the possibility to correct them automatically.

## Step by Step for Cleaning Questions
In this case we differentiate two types of procedures:

### Review for the whole platform _(For platform administrators)_:
1. Access the configuration section of the assStackQuestion plugin.
2. Go to the "Quality Assurance" tab.
3. Select the option "Check PRT Placeholders". (At the moment this is the only check available).

### Check for a specific question pool or test _(For question authors)_:
1. Access the "question pool" or "test" you wish to review.
2. Edit any STACK question within this question pool or test.
3. Go to the Randomisation and Security tab.
4. Click on "Check PRT placeholders" at the bottom of the page (at the moment this is the only check available).

## Error Correction
In some questions after review there will be a button called "Fix" which automatically corrects the error. In other cases, the error will be displayed and you will have to correct it manually.
